## Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict the risk of diabetes in individuals based on relevant health data. The prediction model utilizes a dataset of medical records and employs various machine learning techniques to provide early risk assessments for diabetes. By leveraging this predictive tool, healthcare providers can identify high-risk patients and initiate preventive measures, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes.
